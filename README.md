# CarRunner

Issues I couldn't fix in time:
1) Other cars can collide with each other
2) There is an error thrown when switching from game scene to summary scene, which has to do with events manager. I couldn't find the fix for it and from what I saw it doesn't cause any real issues in the game.

Things I would improve if I had more time:
1) Improve the graphics: the UI components, background, road image, and cars
2) Make the screen bigger so that the player can better see incoming traffic (so it looks closer to the image on the PDF)
3) Fix all areas of the code where I felt it wasn't written well (for example using "FindAllObjectsOfType")
4) Add indication to the player when another car is about to change lanes
